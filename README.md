# Skribbl-Game-MC

Free multiplayer drawing and guessing game. Each game has multiple timed rounds. In each round, one player draws a chosen word while the others guess which word indicates the points. The player with the most points at the end of all rounds wins!
I developed this game to participate in the MicroClub challenge to determine the level in the field of web development, the challenge was directed to club members only.
